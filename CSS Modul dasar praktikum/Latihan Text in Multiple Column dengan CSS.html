            Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content and style, 
            thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the other,

            Your professors will view even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious if there isn’t a careful, 
            coherent argument to give the text meaning. Paragraphs are the “stuff ” of academic writing and, thus, 
            worth our attention here.
